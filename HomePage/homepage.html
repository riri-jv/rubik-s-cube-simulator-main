    <p class="p1">
      As the name says, this is a Simulator for a classic 3X3 Rubik's cube.
      A cube has 6 faces; each of different colour(white, yellow, red, blue, orange, green).
      Each individual unit of a cube is called cubie. There are 27 cubies in total and are also called pieces. 
      There are 8 corner pieces, 12 middles pieces, and 6 center pieces. 
      The center pieces do not move and are costant with respect to each other. 
      With every move made, 8 cubies change their positions. Turing the cube in specific ways creates a pattern. 
      This Simulator will make it possible to try out these fun patterns. 
    </p>


    <p class="p2">
      The left pane has a list of Patterns, which on clicking will show you the steps to follow for making a pattern. 
      Choose the pattern you want to try out and get started. 
      Follow the steps as mentioned on the right side, and see your pattern coming to life. 
      Press the key as mentioned and the cube will make move. 
      The keys are coded as per the original moves. The 'r' for "R" move, and 'R' for "R'" move.
