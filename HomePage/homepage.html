        As the name says, this is a simulator for a classic 3x3 Rubik's Cube.
        A cube has 6 faces, each of a different color (white, yellow, red, blue, orange, green).
        Each individual unit of a cube is called a cubie. There are 27 cubies in total, also called pieces. 
        There are 8 corner pieces, 12 edge pieces, and 6 center pieces. The center pieces do not move.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        Choose a pattern from the left pane, follow the steps on the right, and see your pattern come to life! 
        Press the keys as mentioned, and the simulator will reflect the move.
